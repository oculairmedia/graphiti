# FalkorDB Persistence Strategy - Executive Summary

## Recommended Persistence Strategy

Based on comprehensive research of Redis persistence mechanisms and FalkorDB-specific requirements, we recommend a **hybrid persistence approach** combining AOF (Append-Only File) and RDB (Redis Database) snapshots for production FalkorDB deployments.

### Primary Recommendation: AOF + RDB Hybrid

```redis
# Primary persistence: AOF with every-second fsync
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# Complementary persistence: RDB snapshots
save 900 1      # Save if at least 1 key changed in 900 seconds
save 300 10     # Save if at least 10 keys changed in 300 seconds
save 60 10000   # Save if at least 10000 keys changed in 60 seconds
```

> Graphiti context: This hybrid configuration maps directly to our docker-compose defaults (see falkordb service with REDIS_ARGS). For Graphiti’s ingestion-heavy pipelines (episode creation, enrichment, centrality jobs) and read-heavy search/serving paths (Graphiti API, graphiti-search-rs), AOF everysec limits RPO to ~1s while periodic RDB snapshots keep recovery fast. Ensure this applies only to the FalkorDB service; any separate Redis used as a cache (e.g., graphiti-search-rs REDIS_URL) should typically run with persistence disabled for performance.
> Graphiti note: Configure FalkorDB with maxmemory-policy noeviction to prevent eviction of graph keys. Reserve LRU/TTL-based eviction only for separate Redis caches used by Graphiti services.




## Key Benefits

### 1. **Data Durability**
- **AOF**: Provides excellent durability with maximum 1-second data loss
- **RDB**: Creates point-in-time snapshots for faster recovery
- **Combined**: Best of both worlds - durability and recovery speed

### 2. **FalkorDB Compatibility**
- FalkorDB graph data structures are fully compatible with Redis persistence
- Module state is preserved through Redis RDB/AOF mechanisms
- No special persistence considerations required for graph data

### 3. **Production Readiness**
- Proven in enterprise environments
- Supports automated backup procedures
- Enables disaster recovery with defined RTOs/RPOs

## Performance Impact Summary

| Aspect | AOF Only | RDB Only | Hybrid (Recommended) |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Write Performance** | Moderate impact | Minimal impact | Moderate impact |
| **Memory Usage** | Higher | Lower | Moderate |
| **Recovery Time** | Slower | Faster | Fast (RDB) + Durable (AOF) |
| **Data Loss Risk** | ≤1 second | Up to snapshot interval | ≤1 second |
| **Disk Space** | Higher | Lower | Moderate |

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Basic AOF Setup (Week 1)
- Enable AOF persistence with `appendfsync everysec`
- Implement basic monitoring
- Test data persistence verification

### Phase 2: RDB Integration (Week 2)
- Add RDB snapshots for faster recovery
- Implement automated backup procedures
- Set up backup retention policies

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 3-4)
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Set up disaster recovery procedures
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Documentation and runbook creation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Data Loss**: Maximum 1-second exposure with recommended configuration
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on read operations, moderate on writes
- **Complexity**: Standard Redis persistence, well-documented

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Backup Automation**: Automated daily backups with retention policies
- **Monitoring**: Real-time persistence health monitoring
- **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive operational procedures

## Resource Requirements

### Storage
- **AOF Files**: 2-3x memory size (before rewrite)
- **RDB Files**: ~1x memory size (compressed)
- **Backups**: 7-day retention recommended (adjust based on needs)

### CPU/Memory
- **AOF Impact**: 5-10% additional CPU for fsync operations
- **RDB Impact**: Periodic CPU spikes during background saves
- **Memory**: Additional ~10% for persistence buffers

## Next Steps

1. **Review detailed documentation** in subsequent guides
2. **Plan implementation** following the step-by-step guide
3. **Set up monitoring** using provided metrics and alerts
4. **Test procedures** in non-production environment first
5. **Train operations team** on backup and recovery procedures

## Success Metrics

### Availability
- **Target RTO**: < 5 minutes for service restoration
- **Target RPO**: < 1 second for data loss
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target

### Performance
- **Write Latency**: < 10% increase from baseline
- **Recovery Time**: < 2 minutes for typical dataset sizes
- **Backup Success**: 100% automated backup success rate

## Conclusion

The recommended hybrid AOF + RDB persistence strategy provides the optimal balance of data durability, performance, and operational simplicity for FalkorDB deployments. This approach is battle-tested in production environments and provides the foundation for a robust, enterprise-grade graph database solution.

The strategy minimizes data loss risk while maintaining acceptable performance characteristics and enables comprehensive backup and disaster recovery capabilities essential for production deployments.
