# Frontend Performance Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for refactoring the frontend application to achieve significant performance improvements, based on the findings from the `performance-audit-report.md`.

The plan will be iteratively refined by analyzing the current state of the source code.

## Phase 1: Analysis of Key Components

The following files will be analyzed to create a concrete, step-by-step implementation plan:

-   `frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`
-   `frontend/src/hooks/useVirtualRendering.ts`
-   `frontend/src/workers/dataProcessor.worker.ts`
-   `frontend/src/components/OptimizedGraphCanvas.tsx`

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan

*(This section will be populated after the analysis is complete.)*
