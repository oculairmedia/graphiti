# PRD: Graph Canvas Performance Optimization

## Overview
Comprehensive refactoring of the GraphCanvas component to improve rendering performance, reduce memory usage, and enhance user experience for large-scale graph visualizations.

## Problem Statement
The current GraphCanvas component (`frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`) exhibits significant performance issues when handling large datasets:
- Excessive re-renders causing UI freezing
- Memory leaks during real-time updates
- Inefficient state management with complex interdependencies
- Suboptimal WebGL context usage
- Poor performance with datasets >10k nodes

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce render time by 70%** for graphs with 10k+ nodes
2. **Decrease memory usage by 50%** during continuous operation
3. **Eliminate UI freezing** during data updates
4. **Improve frame rate to 60fps** for standard interactions

### Secondary Goals
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Preserve all current functionality
- Improve code maintainability and testability
- Enable progressive loading for very large datasets

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Render Time**: < 500ms for initial load of 10k nodes
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB for 50k node graphs
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during pan/zoom operations
- **Update Latency**: < 100ms for incremental updates

### Functional Requirements
1. **Efficient State Management**
   - Implement state normalization to reduce update cascades
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Implement proper dependency tracking

2. **Optimized Rendering Pipeline**
   - Batch DOM updates to minimize reflows
   - Implement viewport-based culling
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

3. **Memory Management**
   - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
   - Use WeakMap for temporary object storage
   - Clear unused references promptly

4. **WebGL Optimization**
   - Optimize shader programs for better GPU utilization
   - Implement texture atlasing for better memory usage
   - Use instanced rendering for similar objects

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
```typescript
// Current problematic structure
interface GraphCanvasState {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
  viewport: Viewport;
  // ... 20+ other state variables
}

// Proposed optimized structure
interface OptimizedGraphState {
  entities: NormalizedEntityStore;
  viewport: ViewportState;
  rendering: RenderingState;
  interactions: InteractionState;
}
```

### Key Optimizations
1. **State Normalization**: Convert array-based storage to normalized maps
2. **Selective Re-rendering**: Implement granular update detection
3. **Viewport Culling**: Only render visible elements
4. **Batch Updates**: Group multiple state changes into single renders
5. **Web Worker Integration**: Move heavy computations off main thread

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: State management refactoring (2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Rendering pipeline optimization (2 weeks)
3. **Phase 3**: Memory management improvements (1 week)
4. **Phase 4**: Performance testing and tuning (1 week)

## Success Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Before**: 10k nodes render in 3.2s, 60% CPU usage
- **Target**: 10k nodes render in <1s, <30% CPU usage

### Memory Benchmarks
- **Before**: 1GB memory usage for 20k nodes
- **Target**: <500MB memory usage for 20k nodes

### User Experience Metrics
- Zero UI freezing during updates
- Smooth 60fps interactions
- Sub-second response to user actions

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with datasets: 1k, 10k, 50k, 100k nodes
- Memory profiling during extended usage
- Frame rate monitoring during interactions
- Stress testing with rapid updates

### Compatibility Testing
- Verify all existing features work correctly
- Test with different browser engines
- Validate WebGL context management

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**: Mitigate with comprehensive testing suite
2. **WebGL Compatibility**: Implement fallback rendering modes
3. **Memory Leaks**: Extensive profiling and cleanup verification

### Delivery Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined performance targets
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Prioritize high-impact optimizations first

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Virtual rendering system enhancement
- Data processing pipeline optimization
- Updated TypeScript interfaces

### External Dependencies
- Cosmograph library updates
- React 18+ features (concurrent rendering)
- WebGL 2.0 support verification
