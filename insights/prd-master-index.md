## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)
Run in parallel to establish architectural foundations:
- **Memory Management** (4 weeks) - Critical for preventing leaks during development
- **Component Architecture** (5 weeks) - Required for clean separation of concerns
- **Data Processing Pipeline** (4 weeks) - Supports all other components

### Phase 2: Rendering Optimization (Weeks 6-14)
Build upon foundation work:
- **Virtual Rendering Enhancement** (4 weeks) - Depends on component architecture
- **Graph Canvas Performance** (6 weeks) - Integrates all previous optimizations

### Phase 3: Real-time Features (Weeks 12-16) 
Final integration and real-time capabilities:
- **Real-time Update System** (4 weeks) - Requires stable foundation from all previous work

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple PRDs modify interconnected systems
   - **Mitigation**: Careful dependency management and incremental integration
   
2. **Performance Regression**: Major architectural changes could impact performance
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking at each phase
   
3. **Breaking Changes**: API modifications may affect existing functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility layers during transition

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Memory Management** → All other PRDs (foundation requirement)
2. **Component Architecture** → Virtual Rendering, Graph Canvas (clean interfaces)
3. **Data Processing** → Real-time Updates (streaming foundation)
4. **Virtual Rendering** → Graph Canvas (rendering optimization)
