# Timeline Data Issue Report

## Problem Summary
The GraphTimeline component is showing "empty or invalid timeline data" in the frontend, despite nodes having the correct `created_at_timestamp` field after DuckDB loads.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Data Flow Investigation
Based on console logs analysis:

1. **Initial Load (JSON data)**: 
   - `directTimestamp: undefined` - nodes don't have `created_at_timestamp`
   - Timeline shows: `hasData: false, dataLength: 0`

2. **After DuckDB Load**:
   - `directTimestamp: 1754932850209` - nodes DO have `created_at_timestamp` 
   - Timeline still shows: `hasData: false, dataLength: 0`

3. **Timeline Configuration**:
   - Correctly configured with `accessor="created_at_timestamp"`
   - Correctly set to `useLinksData={false}` (uses node data)

### Key Issues Identified

#### 1. **Timeline Data Access Problem**
- Timeline is trying to use `cosmograph.getPointPositions()` which doesn't exist
- The `CosmographTimeline` component is not properly accessing node data from the Cosmograph instance
- Timeline has cosmograph context (`hasCosmograph: true`) but can't retrieve data

#### 2. **Enhanced Component Data Flow**
- Issue occurs specifically with the enhanced/refactored components
- Timeline works with the old component but not the enhanced one
- Enhanced component uses strict memoization which may prevent timeline updates

#### 3. **Timing/Context Issues**
- Timeline may be checking for data before it's fully loaded
- Possible disconnect between the Cosmograph instance that has data and the one the timeline accesses

## Technical Details

### Console Log Evidence
```
GraphCanvas.tsx:1112 [GraphCanvas] Sample node timestamp check: {
  nodeId: '0018306a-356d-4996-998e-0d6c8c82a037', 
  directTimestamp: 1754932850209,  // ✅ Data exists
  propsTimestamp: 1754932850209,   // ✅ Data exists
  ...
}

GraphTimeline.tsx:46 [GraphTimeline] Cosmograph data check: {
  hasCosmograph: true,
  hasData: false,     // ❌ Timeline can't access data
  dataLength: 0,      // ❌ Timeline sees no data
  sampleData: undefined
}
```

### Code Changes Made
1. **Updated `useGraphDataQuery.ts`**: Added `created_at_timestamp` field preservation
2. **Updated `GraphCanvas.tsx`**: Modified all timestamp calculations to use direct field when available
3. **Added debug logging**: To track data flow through components

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- Nodes have correct `created_at_timestamp` after DuckDB load
- Data transformation preserves timestamp field
- Timeline works with non-enhanced components

### ❌ Not Working  
- Timeline cannot access node data from Cosmograph instance
- Enhanced component timeline shows "empty or invalid timeline data"
- `cosmograph.getPointPositions()` method doesn't exist

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix Options

1. **Investigate Timeline Data Access**
   - Check what methods are actually available on the cosmograph instance
   - Determine correct way for `CosmographTimeline` to access node data
   - May need to use different accessor method or property

2. **Enhanced Component Integration**
   - Ensure timeline is connected to the same Cosmograph instance that has data
   - Check if memoization in enhanced components prevents timeline updates
   - May need to force timeline re-render when data changes

3. **Timeline Component Debug**
   - Add comprehensive logging to see available cosmograph methods
   - Test different data access patterns
   - Verify timeline is receiving correct Cosmograph context

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Timeline Architecture Review**
   - Ensure proper integration between Cosmograph and CosmographTimeline
   - Implement proper data synchronization
   - Add error handling for missing data scenarios

2. **Enhanced Component Optimization**
   - Review memoization strategy to ensure timeline updates
   - Consider timeline-specific data flow optimization
   - Implement proper change detection for temporal data

## Next Steps

1. **Debug cosmograph instance methods** to find correct data access pattern
2. **Test timeline with direct data injection** to isolate the issue
3. **Review Cosmograph documentation** for proper timeline integration
4. **Consider fallback to non-enhanced components** if timeline is critical

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: High - Timeline functionality completely broken in enhanced mode
- **User Impact**: Users cannot use temporal analysis features
- **Workaround**: Switch to non-enhanced components (timeline works there)
- **Timeline**: Should be fixable within 1-2 development cycles once root cause is identified

## Files Affected

- `frontend/src/components/GraphTimeline.tsx` - Timeline component with data access issues
- `frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx` - Updated timestamp field handling
- `frontend/src/hooks/useGraphDataQuery.ts` - Added timestamp field preservation
- `frontend/src/components/GraphViewportEnhancedFixed.tsx` - Enhanced component with memoization

## Investigation Log

### 2025-08-12
- Identified that nodes have correct `created_at_timestamp` after DuckDB load
- Confirmed timeline configuration is correct (`accessor="created_at_timestamp"`)
- Found that timeline cannot access data despite having cosmograph context
- Determined issue is specific to enhanced components
- Added debug logging to track data flow

### Debug Commands Used
```bash
# Check for timeline data access patterns
grep -n "created_at_timestamp.*new Date" frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx

# Search for timeline configuration
grep -n "useLinksData=|accessor=" frontend/src/components/GraphTimeline.tsx
```
