# Cosmograph API Master Index

This section indexes the core Cosmograph API across Classes, Interfaces, and Type Aliases, and links back to the official docs source.

Source: https://next.cosmograph.app/docs-lib/api/internal/README/#interfaces (Internal API)

## Contents

- [Classes](./Classes.md)
- [Interfaces](./Interfaces.md)
  - Detailed: interfaces/*
- [Type Aliases](./Type-Aliases.md)

## Notes

- This master index mirrors the structure from the "internal" API page and provides concise descriptions where available. For authoritative, always-up-to-date details, refer to the official documentation.
- Some internal APIs are advanced/low-level and may change; prefer public, stable APIs when possible.
