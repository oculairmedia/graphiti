# Graphiti Ingestion Pipeline Analysis & Model Optimization Opportunities

## Overview

The Graphiti ingestion pipeline processes episodic content (messages, documents, etc.) into a temporally-aware knowledge graph. Each phase requires different cognitive capabilities, suggesting that specialized models could significantly improve performance.

## Pipeline Phases & Current Challenges

### Phase 1: Entity Extraction (extract_nodes)
**Purpose**: Extract entities (people, organizations, locations, concepts) from text
**Current Approach**: Single LLM call with reflexion loop
**Current Performance**: 17.6s average, 73% F1 score (qwen3-30b)
**Challenges**:
- May miss entities on first pass
- Requires understanding context and relationships
- Must handle custom entity types

**Optimization Tested**: Universal-NER (zeffmuks/universal-ner)
- **Performance**: 1.5s average, 82.4% F1 score
- **Speed improvement**: 11.7x faster than current approach
- **Better accuracy**: 93% precision, 75% recall
- **Supports**: Person, Organization, Location, Time, Money, Title entities

**Alternative Tested**: slim-ner (fast but limited)
- 0.2s average but only extracts person/organization
- Not suitable due to limited entity coverage

### Phase 2: Node Deduplication (dedupe_nodes) 
**Purpose**: Match extracted entities with existing ones in the database
**Current Performance**: 79.2% accuracy with qwen3-30b (JSON mode)
**Tested Models**:
- **gemma3:12b**: 87.5% accuracy ✅ (Winner)
- **qwen3-30b**: 79.2% accuracy (Current)
- **mistral:7b**: 58.3% accuracy
- **granite3.3:8b**: 54.2% accuracy
- **phi4-mini-reasoning**: 25.0% accuracy

**Optimization Implemented**: Switch to gemma3:12b model
- 8.3% accuracy improvement
- Handles name variations better
- No bounds errors with JSON mode

**Key Finding**: JSON mode (`format: "json"`) is essential for reliability

### Phase 3: Edge Extraction (extract_edges)
**Purpose**: Extract relationships between entities
**Current Approach**: LLM identifies relationships with typed edges
**Challenges**:
- Complex relationship types
- Temporal relationships
- Directional relationships
- Custom edge types

**Optimization Opportunity**: Use relationship extraction models
- Models like REBEL, OpenNRE, or fine-tuned models
- Specialized in identifying relationships between entities
- Can handle typed relationships better

### Phase 4: Edge Deduplication (dedupe_edges)
**Purpose**: Match extracted edges with existing relationships
**Current Approach**: LLM-based matching similar to node deduplication
**Challenges**:
- Similar relationships with different phrasings
- Temporal overlap detection
- Relationship strength/confidence

**Optimization Opportunity**: Similar approach to node deduplication
- Test specialized models for relationship matching
- Consider semantic similarity models

### Phase 5: Edge Date Extraction (extract_edge_dates)
**Purpose**: Extract temporal information for relationships
**Current Approach**: LLM extracts dates from context
**Challenges**:
- Implicit temporal references ("last week", "recently")
- Date range extraction
- Timezone handling

**Optimization Opportunity**: Use temporal expression recognition models
- SUTime, HeidelTime, or similar temporal taggers
- Specialized in extracting and normalizing temporal expressions

### Phase 6: Edge Invalidation (invalidate_edges)
**Purpose**: Mark outdated relationships as invalid
**Current Approach**: LLM determines if new information invalidates old edges
**Challenges**:
- Complex temporal reasoning
- Understanding contradictions
- Partial invalidations

**Optimization Opportunity**: This requires reasoning, keep general LLM

### Phase 7: Node Summarization (summarize_nodes)
**Purpose**: Create concise summaries of entity nodes
**Current Approach**: LLM generates summaries from node information
**Challenges**:
- Maintaining key information
- Appropriate length
- Context-aware summaries

**Optimization Opportunity**: Use specialized summarization models
- Models like BART, T5, or Pegasus
- Fine-tuned for entity summarization

### Phase 8: Community Detection & Summary
**Purpose**: Group related entities and summarize communities
**Current Approach**: Graph algorithms + LLM summarization
**Challenges**:
- Meaningful community boundaries
- Multi-level summaries
- Dynamic community evolution

**Optimization Opportunity**: Hybrid approach
- Graph algorithms for detection (already optimized)
- Specialized models for community summarization
