# Bug Fix Report: Graph Edge Visibility Issue

## Issue Summary
Users reported that edges were missing from the graph visualization, with only 1,228 out of 3,517 edges being displayed. The missing edges caused incorrect clustering behavior in the graph physics simulation.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect default value checks in the centrality metric filters. The code was checking if metric filters were active by comparing against the wrong default values:

```javascript
// INCORRECT - checking against 100
const hasMetricFilters = filterConfig.minDegree > 0 || filterConfig.maxDegree < 100 ||
                       filterConfig.minPagerank > 0 || filterConfig.maxPagerank < 100 ||
                       filterConfig.minBetweenness > 0 || filterConfig.maxBetweenness < 100 ||
                       filterConfig.minEigenvector > 0 || filterConfig.maxEigenvector < 100;
```

However, the actual default values for max metrics were 1, not 100:
- `maxPagerank: 1`
- `maxBetweenness: 1`
- `maxEigenvector: 1`

This meant the metric filters were **always active**, even when users hadn't changed any filter settings.

## Impact
1. **396 nodes were incorrectly filtered out** (171 Episodic, 225 Entity)
2. **2,289 edges were lost** because their endpoint nodes were filtered
3. **Only 1,228 edges remained visible** out of 3,517 total
4. Graph clustering appeared incorrect because nodes that should have been connected weren't

## The Fix
Changed the default value checks to match the actual defaults:

```javascript
// CORRECT - checking against 1
const hasMetricFilters = filterConfig.minDegree > 0 || filterConfig.maxDegree < 100 ||
                       filterConfig.minPagerank > 0 || filterConfig.maxPagerank < 1 ||
                       filterConfig.minBetweenness > 0 || filterConfig.maxBetweenness < 1 ||
                       filterConfig.minEigenvector > 0 || filterConfig.maxEigenvector < 1;
```

This ensures metric filters are only active when users have actually changed them from defaults.

## Debug Journey & Lessons Learned

### Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect)
We initially suspected the issue was related to centrality calculations modifying nodes, so we:
- Removed centrality data from the Rust server
- Stripped centrality properties from nodes in the frontend
- Fixed edge transformation for Cosmograph v2.0 compatibility

**Result**: No improvement - edges were still missing.

### Second Hypothesis (Partially Correct)
We discovered nodes were being filtered due to having "0 connections":
- Created a connections map to count actual edges per node
- Modified the connection filter to use real edge counts
- Added checks to skip filtering when data wasn't ready

**Result**: Still didn't work because the real issue was elsewhere.

### Third Hypothesis (Incorrect)
We thought it was a race condition with empty data structures:
- Added dependencies to force re-rendering when data populated
- Tried to skip all filtering when nodeTypeVisibility was empty

**Result**: Briefly showed all edges, then they disappeared again.

### Final Discovery (Correct)
Through detailed debugging, we found:
1. Nodes with 19 connections were still being filtered
2. The metric filters were always active due to incorrect default checks
3. Nodes without centrality data (defaulting to 0) failed the 0-1 range check

## Unnecessary Changes Made
During debugging, we made several changes that weren't needed:
1. Removed centrality data from Rust server (could be reverted)
2. Added complex connection counting logic (could be simplified)
3. Added multiple debug statements (should be removed)
4. Modified filter bypass logic for empty nodeTypeVisibility (could be reverted)

## Final Solution
A simple one-line fix changing the default value checks from 100 to 1 for the three centrality metrics resolved the entire issue.

## Verification
After the fix:
- All 3,122 nodes are visible
- All 3,517 edges are visible
- Graph clustering behaves correctly
- No functionality was lost
